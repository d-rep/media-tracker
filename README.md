Media Tracker
=============

This is a simple web application, for tracking any media that you consume, such as books, TV shows, movies, or video games.

This is meant to illustrate how to build an old school Java web application, using the Spring 3, Struts 2, & Hibernate frameworks.  It is built with Maven and Java 1.6.

The Eclipse metadata is included, so the project can be imported into Spring Tool Suite.

It is being actively developed and is unfinished.
